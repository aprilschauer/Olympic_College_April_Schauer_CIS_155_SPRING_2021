   <h1>Included in V1</h1>
   <p>In V1 I created html pages for index, about, portfolio, get to know me, and services,<br> 
      though the last three are blank for now. I created a home page using the index and created<br>
	  navigation to link the pages together. The home page also has an external link to Amazon as<br> 
	  "check out my gear" as well as an image. The home and about pages have a header, title, and footer.<br>
	  I created a stylesheet has been used to change the font and navigation link colors, the font size and style<br>
	  in the header and footer and create a horizontal navigation.
